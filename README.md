## A project from my desire to play Sound Voltex at home.
During my time in Japan I spent a lot of time at arcades and a game that stood out to me was Sound Voltex. I had the idea when I saw that people had made an open source clone of Sound Voltex called ![Unnamed Sound Voltex Clone](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone). I took inspiration from another user project called ![Pocket Voltex](https://mon.im/sdvx/). However, they were not selling it at the time, so I made my own.

While this project was built, it has already been disassembled to use the Arduino Micro for different projects and due to my waning interest in the game. However files and a CAD preview have been posted. This project did not have a custom PCB and was completely hand wired.
